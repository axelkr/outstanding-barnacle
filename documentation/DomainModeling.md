## State Model
Each state model is a connected graph of states, with one state designated as initial and several states designated as final states. New Kanban cards start in the inital state. A Kanban card in a final state is considered to be completed. The latter is useful for statistics as cards can be considered to have reached the end of their usefulness to the organisation and it's expected that no more work is put into them.
